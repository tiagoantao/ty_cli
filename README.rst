Intro
=====

ty_cli is an extremely opinionated command line parsing
library. Because it decides everything for you, its interface is dead
simple. Its particularly good if you need a quick CLI interface with
almost zero effort.

It is based and requires type annotations (a la in mypy). It requires
Python 3.6 or above.
