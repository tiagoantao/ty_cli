Development
===========


Building documentation
----------------------

python setup.py build_sphinx


Code formatting
---------------

We use Python Black for formatting.

Documentation is produced with Sphinx.

RST format is used *inside* Python comments.

Testing
-------

Test coverage has a minimum of 100%. Really.

We use tox and pytest. Call `tox` to test.
