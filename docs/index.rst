ty_cli: A very opinionated command line parser
==============================================

`ty_cli` is an extremely opinionated command line parsing
library. Because it decides everything for you, its interface is dead
simple. Its particularly good if you need a quick CLI interface with
almost zero effort.

It is based on and requires type annotations (Ã  la mypy). Uses Python
3.8 or above.

Here is a first example::
